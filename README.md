# python-challenge

#Homework for week three. I started taking notes and this helped but I have stepped it for week 4 which has allowed me to complete class excercises 
for the most part since I have a reference for the different functions.

#This homework was challenging because I knew basically what I had to do but not necessarilly how and in some cases in what order.
